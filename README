QFacebookGraph - A Qt model/view based Facebook Graph API sdk.

This is very early alpha stages, so at this moment is just a skeleton library.
In a few days we expect a fully functional API.

The initial intentions is have the most minimal possible requirements to use it.
The only current requires are Qt <qt.nokia.com> and QJson <http://qjson.sourceforge.net/>
