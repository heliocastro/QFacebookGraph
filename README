QFacebookGraph - A Qt model/view based Facebook Graph API sdk.

This is he 0.1 version ( alpha ) of QFacebooGraph library. Basic User object
data can be used.
Two examples are available under examples.

First one userpublicdata, relies
directly on public data without authentication. Is a console only example.
It shows how to use directly the base class, and not one of the helper classes.

Second one is a poor implemented qml based app, that have the single purpose to
serve as a testbed to test helper classes. Is doing standard facebok auth using
webkit and fetch some user data and user home wall feed.
It shows how to use the helper classes.

Since not all models are implemented yet, this is a on request implemention
process. All help is welcome, and will be well received.

The only current requires are Qt <qt.nokia.com> and QJson <http://qjson.sourceforge.net/>
